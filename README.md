# Whatsapp-chat-analysis-dashboard

## Introduction 
I noticed how much messages flooded my whatsapp at time intervals, particularly from my class group. I decided to analyse the group's activities for the past six months as part of practising what i learnt in data cleaning and visualisation. 
#### Power BI concepts applied:
* DAX concepts : custom Table and columns

## Problem statement
* Who are the most active persons?
* When is the group very interactive?
* Which month was the most interactive?
* How much messages get into the group?

## Data sourcing
I downloaded the data as a csv file from the whatsapp group with the help of a whatsapp feature "Export" into my email and then to my drive.
I extracted the data into Power BI for cleaning , analysis and visualisation.

## Data Transformation
The data was been cleaned and transformed with the Power Query Editor of Power BI. The data was in a single column , I split the required fields by delimeter, renamed the columns, changed the data types and finally filtered out blanks. Attached is the downloaded csv file

## Data Modelling
No modelling was required since it was just a table

## Data analysis and visuals

The following insights were gotten:
* Mickey Money is the most active person in the group.
* The group becomes very interactive during the late minutes of 10PM and early minutes of 11PM.
* Febuary was the most interactive month 
* 39,150 messages were sent to the group at the interval of six months

## Conclusion and recommendation
* It can be seen that the group is very much interactive in the late hours of the night, thus it can be concluded that students chat more late in the night. 
* If an inteactive session is to be held in the group, there would be more participants around 11PM.
